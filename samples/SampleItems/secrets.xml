    This sample secrets.xml file exists in App_Data. Which is obviously checked into source control
    for the purpose of being a sample. It is recommended that you reference a secrets file that exists
    outside of your souce control for development configurations. Using the "Manage User Secrets"
    feature of Visual Studio will wire up a random secrets file for you without the need for
    directly specifying a file via the 'userSecretsFile' or 'userSecretsId' attributes.
