# MicrosoftConfigurationBuilders FAQ

TODO - search for 'expand'
We get a lot of questions about `KeyValueConfigBuilders` - and Configuration Builders in general. Here are
some of the most frequent along with answers that are hopefully helpful.


<details>
  <summary><a name="expand"><b>Why did you get rid of 'Expand' mode?</b></a></summary>
  
  Because 'Expand' mode operated in the 'ProcessRawXml' phase of configuration building, while the other
  modes all operate in 'ProcessConfigurationSection.' It was a bit of a balancing act trying to develop
  features that work across both phases - a challenge which is sometimes quite difficult given the lack of
  information we have about the section we are processing in 'ProcessRawXml.'
  
  For example, V3 of these builders tries to accomodate 'ConfigurationManager.OpenConfiguration()'
  scenarios where apps want to read a config file that is not their own. In these cases, we need to
  know information about the file and section we are processing that we just can't know in the
  'ProcessRawXml' phase. Another example is the [parameters from appSettings](KeyValueConfigBuilders.md#appsettings-parameters)
  feature which was disabled in 'Expand' mode while processing the appSettings section, but can
  still be used somewhat functionally when executing any of the modes that operate in 'ProcessConfigurationSection.'

  To make things simpler across the board, 'Expand' mode was replaced with 'Token' mode which should
  operate in a fairly similar manner with the added benefit of being less prone to producing invalid
  XML to muck things up. :smiley:

  <summary><a name="newhandler"><b>Can you add a `SectionHandler` for section `XYZ?`</b></a></summary>
  
  We have included default `SectionHandlers` for `<appSettings>` and `<connectionStrings>` because they
  are by far the most commonly used "key/value" config sections. But we introduced the `SectionHandler<T>`
  API to allow for more sections to be processed.

  We don't currently feel that there are any other sections out there that have enough demand to
  warrant including a default section handler in the base package that everybody is required to use.
  That does not mean that section handlers for other sections is not ever a valid scenario, and you
  are of course welcome and encouraged to leverage the section handler feature if it suits your needs.
  That is why we introduced the feature afterall.

<details>
  <summary><a name="applicationsettings"><b>Can you add a `SectionHandler` for the client `ApplicationSettings` section?</b></a></summary>
  
  See [above](#newhandler). `ApplicationSettings` is less commonly used. But more problematically, it
  isn't really a standard .Net configuration section like it appears to be on first glance. The classes
  that support ApplicationSettings provide a strict and strongly typed window into what looks like a
  standard configuration section in your app.config file. While we can easily write a section handler
  for the `ClientSettingsSection` ([example](../samples/SampleSectionHandlers/ClientSettingsSectionHandler.cs))
  it won't integrate into the ApplicationSettings framework seamlessly like one might expect. The
  ApplicationSetting framework has already determined the number and names (including casing, which
  is problematic in 'Greedy' mode) of all the settings it will present before the base configuration
  system even gets a crack at reading from the config file. So you can't *add* new values with 'Greedy'
  mode, and you can't override existing values in 'Greedy' mode if you don't properly match
  casing - despite the fact that ApplicationSettings is supposed to be case-insensitive.

  If you wish, you can use the [sample section handler](../samples/SampleSectionHandlers/ClientSettingsSectionHandler.cs)
  to process ApplicationSettings in your application, but know that the use case is rather limited.
  It will work in 'Strict' mode... and maybe require some prodding to force the ApplicationSettings
  framework to forget the settings it's seen before and decide to look back into the config file to
  get new values.

  You can read more about the architecture of the AppliationSettings framework [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/advanced/application-settings-architecture?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8)
  to see how it builds layers on top of the standard config system that often obscure any changes or
  additional settings that appear in the `ClientSettingsSection` but won't be seen in
  `MyApp.Properties.Settings`. That set of articles is also a good starting point for learning
  about `SettingsProvider` and how that might be leveraged to accomplish configuration injection
  through a different mechanism in the case when applications must use ApplicationSettings.

  <summary><a name="azureappservices"><b>Do ConfigBuilders break the 'Application Settings' feature of Azure AppServices?</b></a></summary>
  
  Maybe a little? It does appear that adding a 'configBuilders' tag to your 'appSettings' or 'connectionStrings'
  sections confuses the injection logic for the Azure AppServices "Application Settings" feature. I do not
  have any insight as to why that is other than to say that the two features "grew up" contemporaneously, so
  they were probably not aware that configBuilders could exist.

  But all is not lost. The "Application Settings" feature injects all it's values into the environment of
  the service. So while using ConfigBuilders might interfere with the automatic injection of those values,
  you can also use ConfigBuilders to pull those values back in. See [this issue comment](#133#issuecomment-1049520479)
  for more details.

  <summary><a name="iisschema"><b>Why does IIS/inetmgr complain about configBuilders?</b></a></summary>
  
  Because IIS config tools are old and cranky, just like the old .Net config system wanted them to be. :smiling_imp:

  The old .Net config system is supposed to be quite rigid and super-strongly typed. So when IIS developed
  tools to work with config, they took steps to ensure they didn't break folks by creating invalid configuration.
  In particular, they decided to use XML schema's to ensure the XML they save is on the up-and-up. (Just
  like Visual Studio does. But Visual Studio gets updated quite a bit more frequently than IIS tools and
  has a lower bar for fixing nagging bugs that have a workaround - and was therefore better equipped to
  change with the times when .Net config added new features and sections. Also, failing schema validation
  in Visual Studio simply resulted in red squiggles instead of error dialogs. :frowning:)

  The workaround is really quite simple, but it isn't something we can do in these packages. As suggested
  in #126, simply add a schema file for IIS to help it understand that configBuilders are ok on some
  sections.

  `%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\config\schema\configBuilders_schema.xml`
  ```xml
<configSchema>
  <sectionSchema name="appSettings">
      <attribute name="configBuilders" type="string"/>
  </sectionSchema>
  <sectionSchema name="connectionStrings">
      <attribute name="configBuilders" type="string"/>
  </sectionSchema>
</configSchema>
  ```

  <summary><a name="windowscontainers"><b>My config builder isn't working in my Windows container.</b></a></summary>
  
  That's a statement, not a question. But here's a likely explanation.

  Windows containers only modify the environment block of the EntryPoint process. So if your application
  is running as a service (like IIS/ASP.Net apps) or some other process not directly created by the
  EntryPoint, any environment variables set when starting the container will not be visible to your
  app.

  To work around this issue, [ASP.Net](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/tree/main/src/aspnet)
  and [IIS](https://github.com/microsoft/iis-docker) container images rely on a `ServiceMonitor.exe`
  utility to be the entry point for the container, and this utility proactively modifies the environment
  of the worker process with any additional environment variables passed to docker run.

  For IIS/ASP.Net workloads, do try to use an IIS/ASP.Net derived container that uses `ServiceMonitor.exe.`
  For other workloads, try making your app the EntryPoint, or try a similar approach to how IIS/ASP.Net
  handle this... possibly even leveraging [ServiceMonitor.exe](https://github.com/Microsoft/IIS.ServiceMonitor)
  itself.

  <summary><a name="vstyperes"><b>Why do I get an error in Visual Studio when I switch my web app to use IIS instead of IISExpress?</b></a></summary>
  
  Many reasons. The gist of the situation is this... When you switch your web application to run in IIS
  instead of IISExpress, Visual Studio tries to read your config file to parse connection strings. I
  believe it's looking for 'LocalDB', but that's not really important. Your web app's config file is
  obviously not part of the process configuration for devenv.exe, so VS opens it via
  `ConfigurationManager.OpenConfiguration()` or something similar. Prior to V3, this was likely to
  result in failures in many of these key/value config builders if they were applied to the
  `<connectionStrings>` section.

  In V3, we handle the `ConfigurationManager.OpenConfiguration()` scenario better, but we can still
  get tripped up by the insanely complicated way Visual Studio manages reference binding. As a result,
  there may be version mis-matches when trying to load some builders. The Azure builders seem particularly
  vulnerable to this. I haven't found a good way to deal with this.

  **However,** even though the error appears in a scary dialog box, it does not affect the behavior of
  your application. When running/debugging your app on local IIS, the config builders are still able to
  execute as expected.
